# Interactive-Art
Art projects made using Processing, utilizing programing to make art engaging to the viewer.
When I was introduced to this software in my college digital imaging class, I immediately saw the potential it held.
I love both art and programming so combining them to creative interactive art pieces just made sense.
I hope that you enjoy my art

NOTE: You will need to download OpenJDK 17 in to ensure the programs to work.
